a variable inside a function, said variable becomes global when
defined, or modifies the assigned value to an existing global
variable.

When in doubt, the JS interpreter will always prioritize
local scope variables when both local and global variables have
the same name.    */

the function task will stop and return the proper output.    */

This is called Anonymous functions, when functions have no name.
It can be shortened even further by converting it into an arrow
function:

var magic = () => {
    return new Date();
};

As seen, there is an 'arrow' after the parentheses which simplifies
the writing, but it can be simplified even more:

var magic = () => new Date();    */
